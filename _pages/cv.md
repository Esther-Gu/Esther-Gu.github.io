* [Triple Uncertainties: Credence Goods, Deceptive Counterfeits, and Fake Product Reviews](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3915087). (With Hubert Pun and Fredrik Odegaard)
  * Worried about unwittingly buying counterfeits, online customers often resort to “the wisdom of crowds” (e.g., product reviews) before purchasing. However, unethical sellers may game the review system through buying fake reviews. In this paper, we use a two-period game theoretical model to study a market that consists of an authentic seller and a deceptive counterfeiter; they sell credence goods (e.g., nutritional supplements and N95 masks) whose qualities are difficult to evaluate, so customers cannot differentiate genuine products from counterfeits even after consumption. In the beginning, the authentic seller decides the level of selling effort. In the first period, customers make purchasing decisions and leave either positive or negative product reviews. In the second period, the counterfeiter decides whether to buy fake positive product reviews. Then, each seller may receive a product badge that is granted based on the fraction of reviews being positive. Customers update their beliefs about sellers’ authenticity depending on badge status and then make purchasing decisions. We find that the authentic seller can benefit, while the counterfeiter can be worse off, from the counterfeiter having an option to buy fake product review. We also show that the fake review option can increase consumer surplus. Lastly, even though the counterfeiter bears the cost of fake review, the counterfeiter can be better off from a higher price of fake review, whereas the authentic seller is worse off.
  


* False Revealed Preference and Limited Attention.
  * I apply a statistical model and an analytical model of bounded rationality to explain empirical violation of revealed preference, using dataset from an experiment of choice-making conducted at University of California, Berkeley. Individuals have limited attention when making decisions; once individuals have become fatigued of the decision-making process, they pay much less attention to their choices and are more likely to violate the revealed preference axiom. In particular, I find that individuals have heterogenous fatigue points that follow log-normal distribution. Their violation of weak axiom of revealed preference can also be explained through an analytical model that includes attention index.
