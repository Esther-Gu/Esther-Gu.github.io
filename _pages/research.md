Dissertation Research 
======
I am working on revising the full draft of my thesis. We have almost finished the research part, but we will further revise it. We plan to send a paper from the thesis to a journal in Oct 2022:
* Gu, H., Rahrovani Y, Austin R. Innovating Product Meaning with Digital Technology in the Case of Electric Vehicles: A Design and Feedback Perspective. Now in the final stage of submission preparation.



  

Other Research 
======
I have another project on how products reach optimal distinctiveness with digital technology with Yasser and Rob. I am responsible for drafting the paper and I contribute to the conceptualization. Now we have written a version of the literature review. The theoretical development part is in progress. We expect to submit this paper in Oct 2022.
