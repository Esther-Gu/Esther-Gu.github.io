Dissertation Research 
======
I have written all seven chapters of my thesis. I am revising the full draft of my thesis. I plan to send a paper from the thesis to a top IS journal in Oct 2022:
* Gu, H., Rahrovani Y, Austin R. Innovating Product Meaning with Digital Technology in the Case of Electric Vehicles. Now in the final stage of submission preparation.
 
Work in Progress
======
My second research project is about designers’ strategies to reach optimal distinctiveness for radically innovative products. I used archival case studies to explore how designers manipulate uncertainties to deliver a coherent product design. This project is in the theorizing stage and is expected to submit to an IS top journal by Dec 2022.

* Rahrovani, Y., Gu, H., Austin R. Reaching Optimal Distinctiveness at Different Product Dimensions: Case studies in Designers’ Strategies to Influence User Perceptions by Changing Interpretive Flexibility and Sending Signals Over Time. Now in the stage of theoretical development

My third research project is under review. The paper is related to leadership emergence in Open Source Software context.
