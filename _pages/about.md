I hold a PhD degree in Business Administration, specialized in Information Systems, from the Ivey Business School at the Western University. While Iâ€™ve been offered an esteemed Assistant Professor position at Durham University, a QS top 100 institution, I made a transition into the industry. 

Now I work as a senior consultant at EY Canada to help business corporations, large or small, to claim government tax incentives for their technology innovation efforts. These technological innovations truly get me excited.

Outside work, I enjoy reading, writing, investing, and working out. 

My strong skills encompass:
* Proficiency in writing, communicating, and programming
* Aptitude for data science and statistical modeling
