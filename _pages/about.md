Hi I am Esther (Haoyue) Gu, a PhD candidate in Information Systems at Ivey Business School, Western University, Canada. My advisors are Prof. [Yasser Rahrovani](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/yasser-rahrovani/) and Prof. [Robert Austin](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/rob-austin/). My CV can be found [here](https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hgu53_uwo_ca/Documents/6%20Job%20market/20220430%20Esther%20(Haoyue)%20Gu_CV.pdf).

I am on the job market during 2022-2023. 

My primary research interests include innovation management in the context of electric vehicles. Specifically, I focus on innovation in product meaning with digital technology. This topic is important because users choose products not only for functions and aesthetics, but also for product meaningâ€”the symbolic, psychological, and cultural associations that were proposed by designers. Through case studies, I found that digital technology interacts with product meaning in different ways such as being a part of the product and supporting new ways of presenting the product. In the future, I will further study how product meaning evolves with digital technology and how products reach optimal distinctiveness with digital technology.
