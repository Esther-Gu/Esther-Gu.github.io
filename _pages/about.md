Hi I am Esther (Haoyue) Gu, a PhD candidate in Information Systems at Ivey Business School, Western University, Canada. My advisors are Prof. [Yasser Rahrovani](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/yasser-rahrovani/) and Prof. [Robert Austin](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/rob-austin/). My CV can be found [here](https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/hgu53_uwo_ca/ETNHhCey1AJPrmg9CJAEVlkB5BJm2pEOt9o52SGjHliDKA?e=5dWuM3).

I am on the job market now, looking for tenure track assistant professor position in Information Systems. 

My primary research interests include Digital Technology and Innovation. My research speaks to debates in Information Systems with two themes. One, I focus on innovating meaning with digital technology. I aim to stretch the IS scholars’ imagination to go beyond innovation in functions and aesthetics. Digital technology could also be understood as a way to radically innovate product meaning. Second, I study designer innovation. When it comes to innovating meaning with digital technology, designers are not passive implementers of user feedback and expectorations. Rather, designers may envision an innovative product meaning and proactively influence users’ interpretations of product meaning with digital technology. I take a designer-centric perspective to study innovation with digital technology in product meaning. I use qualitative case studies in the context of electric vehicles in my thesis, and I might also use mixed methods in the future.
