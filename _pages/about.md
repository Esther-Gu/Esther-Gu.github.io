I've recently completed my PhD in Information Systems at Western University. Now I plan to rest briefly before commencing a new job-searching journey in the Business or IT sectors within Canada in September 2023.

While I’ve been offered an esteemed Assistant Professor position at Durham University, a QS top 100 institution, I’m committed to making a transition into the industry.

My strong skills encompass:
* Proficiency in Python programming
* Aptitude for data science and statistical modeling
* Proficiency in data analysis using SQL and Excel
* Expertise in business communication, pre-sales skills, and consulting
     
I welcome any potential opportunities that align with my skills and career aspirations. Please feel free to reach out if you know of any suitable roles. Thank you!
