Hi I am Esther (Haoyue) Gu, a PhD candidate in Information Systems at Ivey Business School, Western University, Canada. My advisors are Prof. [Yasser Rahrovani](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/yasser-rahrovani/) and Prof. [Robert Austin](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/rob-austin/). My CV can be found [here](https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/hgu53_uwo_ca/EURoWQHDCtpNmEdBP7EuZIoBpNMvD6-qP6fEEcX5q3LHjQ?e=qPYg3F).

I am on the job market during 2022-2023. 

My primary research interests include innovation management in the context of electric vehicles. Specifically, I focus on innovation in product meaning with digital technology. This topic is important because users choose products not only for functions and aesthetics, but also for product meaning—the symbolic, psychological, and cultural associations that were proposed by designers. Through case studies, I found that digital technology interacts with product meaning in different ways such as being a part of the product and supporting new ways of presenting the product. In the future, I will further study how product meaning evolves with digital technology and how products reach optimal distinctiveness with digital technology.
