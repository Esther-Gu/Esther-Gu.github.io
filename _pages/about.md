Hi I am Esther (Haoyue) Gu, a PhD candidate in Information Systems at Ivey Business School, Western University, Canada. My advisors are Prof. [Yasser Rahrovani](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/yasser-rahrovani/) and Prof. [Robert Austin](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/rob-austin/). My CV can be found [here](https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/hgu53_uwo_ca/ETNHhCey1AJPrmg9CJAEVlkB5BJm2pEOt9o52SGjHliDKA?e=5dWuM3).

I am on the job market now. 

My primary research interests include digital technology and product innovation in Information Systems. In my thesis, I investigate how designers use digital technology to innovate product meaning. Designers can propose what would be “desirable to users” and redefine what a product means with digital technology, which goes beyond using digital technology to improve product functions and aesthetics. For example, in the context of electric vehicles (EV), designers may propose a meaning of EV as a toy or a living room and choose appropriate digital technology to change the product itself or its external associations. I use qualitative comparative case studies methods with the software NVivo. I interviewed designers and collected archival qualitative data, too. 

My thesis speaks to two debates in IS. One, I aim to stretch the imagination of using digital technology as a part of the product, e.g., to make a more functional or prettier product. I focus on how digital technology influences radical product meaning innovation. Second, I take a designer-centric perspective, looking at how designers take user feedback when they innovate product meaning. Such a designer perspective complements the current IS research that focuses on user preferences.
