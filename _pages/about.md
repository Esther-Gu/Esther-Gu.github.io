Welcome! I am Yongqin Lei, a second-year PhD student in Management Science at Ivey Business School, Western University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Hubert Pun](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/hubert-pun/) and Prof. [Fredrik Odegaard](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/fredrik-odegaard/). I am broadly interested in behavorial economics, pricing strategies, and counterfeiting products.
