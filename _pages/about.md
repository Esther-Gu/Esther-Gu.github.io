Welcome to my site! My name is Yongqin Lei, and I am a 2nd year PhD student in Management Science at Ivey Business School, Western University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Hubert Pun](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/hubert-pun/) and Prof. [Fredrik Odegaard](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/fredrik-odegaard/). 

I mainly use game-theoretical model to study topics of interest, including counterfeiting in online marketplaces and business applications of blockchain. I am also interested in behavior economics, and how people's seemingly violation of revealed preference can be explained through models of bounded rationality.
