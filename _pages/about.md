I am a PhD candidate at Ivey Business School, Western University, graduating in June 2023. I am actively seeking roles in Toronto as a credit analyst, data analyst, consultant, or user experience researcher. If you are aware of any opportunities that align with my skillset, please feel free to reach out.
With expertise in data analysis using Python, R, Excel VBA, and Stata, I recently completed a credit risk analysis Python where I built and validated machine learning models. You can find the details of the project on my GitHub repository: [GitHub Project](https://github.com/Esther-Gu/CreditRiskAnalysis/blob/main/code_description.md).

In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong business acumen and experience in problem-solving within the technology innovation management field. Over the past six years, I have conducted interviews with executives, product managers, and engineers in the electric vehicle industry to gain insights into next-generation product development. I was honored to present my findings at a prestigious conference in the field: [Conference Presentation](https://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2022/hci_robot/hci_robot/4/).

While I have received an assistant professor offer from Durham University, a top 100 university worldwide, I am eager to transition to the industry and make a real impact. I am excited to leverage my skills and passion in a professional setting.

I am actively looking for opportunities outside of academia, and I am open to exploring challenging roles that allow me to contribute to a dynamic and innovative team. If you have any leads or suggestions, please do not hesitate to connect with me.
