Welcome! I am Yongqin Lei, a second-year PhD student in Management Science at Ivey Business School, Western University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Hubert Pun](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/hubert-pun/) and Prof. [Fredrik Odegaard](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/fredrik-odegaard/). My CV can be found [here]([https://iveyca-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/ylei_phd_ivey_ca/EYFpOaKdzshGtMeL8o1YNEABGQQdqnoDW9SFknRqMDiPrg?e=PUDLwH](https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hgu53_uwo_ca/Documents/6%20Job%20market/20220430%20Esther%20(Haoyue)%20Gu_CV.pdf)).

My primary research interests include innovation management in the context of electric vehicles. Specifically, I focus on innovation in product meaning with digital technology. This topic is important because users choose products not only for functions and aesthetics, but also for product meaningâ€”the symbolic, psychological, and cultural associations that were proposed by designers. Through case studies, I found that digital technology interacts with product meaning in different ways such as being a part of the product and supporting new ways of presenting the product. In the future, I will further study how product meaning evolves with digital technology and how products reach optimal distinctiveness with digital technology.
