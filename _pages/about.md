I am a diligent PhD candidate in Information Systems at Western University, with my defense scheduled for June 2023. Post-defense, I plan to rest briefly before commencing a new journey in the Business or IT sectors within Canada from September 2023.

While I've been offered an esteemed Assistant Professor position at Durham University, a QS top 100 institution, I'm committed to making a transition into the industry. 

My strong skills encompass:
* Proficiency in Python programming
* Aptitude for data science and statistical modeling
* Proficiency in data analysis using SQL and Excel
* Expertise in business communication, pre-sales skills, and consulting

I welcome any potential opportunities that align with my skills and career aspirations. Please feel free to reach out if you know of any suitable roles. Thank you!
