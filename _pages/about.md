Welcome! I am Yongqin Lei, a second-year PhD student in Management Science at Ivey Business School, Western University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Hubert Pun](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/hubert-pun/) and Prof. [Fredrik Odegaard](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/faculty/directory/fredrik-odegaard/). My CV can be found [here](https://iveyca-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/ylei_phd_ivey_ca/EYFpOaKdzshGtMeL8o1YNEABGQQdqnoDW9SFknRqMDiPrg?e=PUDLwH).

I mainly use game-theoretical model to study topics of interest, including counterfeiting in online marketplaces and pricing strategies. I am also interested in behavior economics, and how people's seeming violation of revealed preference can be explained by models of bounded rationality.
