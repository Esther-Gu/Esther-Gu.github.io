My teaching statement can be found [here]([https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/hgu53_uwo_ca/Efj86JyDWmROitImH_WCiWsB52a1G6Arnk3_EE5nAlRhQA?e=OaA4hS](https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/hgu53_uwo_ca/EeIqwPIhPttMt3Ivw26G8sEBtSf3KYBj_HMCz7VzYAE5kg?e=z4uwUZ).

I foster an inclusive learning environment and help students from underrepresented backgrounds to succeed. See my diversity statement [here](https://uwoca-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/hgu53_uwo_ca/EeIEtHatDyZMjXAj7XUBb9UBdtbnnxjRQ-Lb0E-Frd8mww?e=eR8m4d).

My teaching style is highly interactive. I benefited a lot from the influence of [Ivey case-based teaching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLueM_EHOLE).
